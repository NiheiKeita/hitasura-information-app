# Project Guidelines

## Development Workflow
- After finishing implementation, run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test`.

## Architecture
- Use the controller–presentation pattern.
- When logic becomes complex, create a controller to manage the behavior.

## Testing
- Write tests thoroughly for new behavior and changes.
